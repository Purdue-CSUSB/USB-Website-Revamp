# Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board Constitution

**Revision 1/2/2022**

## Article I
### Name

The name of this organization shall be the Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board.

## Article II
### Purposes

The Purdue Department of Computer Science is ever-growing and improving, and this growth requires active student involvement and assistance. The Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board (USB) exists to promote a supportive and engaged community within Purdue's Computer Science Department, and to use its relationship with faculty, the Computer Science Corporate Partners Program, and administration to advocate for the student body. The goals of the board include:

- Reducing the communication gap between the students and the faculty by representing the concerns of the students,
- Facilitating the flow of communication between the faculty, staff, corporate partners and the students,
- Providing the student body with a means of affecting the policy decisions of the department,
- Allowing the students, faculty, and administration of the Computer Science Department easy access to dedicated, motivated students to help in departmental programs and recruitment operations,
- Teaching undergraduate computer science courses, mentoring or tutoring the undergraduate student body, and attending department events,
- Creating events for the undergraduate student body,
- Exposing all students to opportunities within Computer Science and Data Science at Purdue.

## Article III
### Membership

Membership in the Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board is open to any Purdue University Computer Science undergraduate or Data Science undergraduate student who is interested in issues and concerns with respect to computer science, the department, and the curriculum. This includes members outside of the CS/DS department who can demonstrate a vested interest in the activities of the department and a willingness to contribute to USB initiatives. This interest should be demonstrated through an interview and/or resume review, and a ⅔ agreement of their eligibility by the board. Membership and participation are free from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, or status as a veteran. Members and candidates who are considered for membership of the board will be expected to show substantial interest and activity in the Computer Science department itself. New members shall be elected onto the board after an interview and application review. New member elections shall take place during the end of the spring semester, in the month of April. New candidates for board membership will be evaluated in a manner seen fit by the board, such as a resume screening and interview process. The new candidates will become official members once they attend their first meeting.

The Undergraduate Student Board shall consist of no less than six members: there shall be a minimum of two seniors, two juniors, and two sophomores among the members of the board. There shall also be a cap on the number of members. At the full capacity of 25 members, there will be a minimum of six seniors, six juniors, and six sophomores on the board. There are an additional seven positions on USB that may be filled with candidates of any year. If there is a member who was formerly a senior and continues to be a member, they do not count towards the maximum of 25 members. USB greatly benefits from long-term members as well as the diversity of opinions from students of different ages and thus, these membership rules ensure that USB will remain a reasonable size. If in the future, the board sees that its responsibilities are increasing, the board may then decide to increase this cap by voting to edit this Constitution.

New members shall be elected onto the board after an interview and resume review. New members can be added to the board at any time during the spring and fall semesters if another member is away from campus for an extended period of time. These special appointments will only take place at the discretion of the President.

If the board decides that a member should be disciplined, they may do so by a ⅔ majority vote. The first course of discipline will be a verbal warning from the President to the member in question. The second course of discipline will be a written Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) which will detail the issues and guide the member in correcting them. The PIP will be written by the President and approved by the Faculty Advisor(s). The final course of discipline is a ⅔ majority vote to remove the member.

The President reserves the right to begin disciplinary proceedings without a board vote, but the final decision must still be decided by a ⅔ majority vote by the board members. The President must inform the Faculty Advisor(s) of all discipline situations.

Should a member resign or be asked to step down over the course of the year, their spot will be open for elections in the next election cycle. If a member leaves campus for an extended period of time, their position on the board will still exist upon their return and arrival to campus, provided that proper accommodations were set up between that member and the rest of the board ahead of time.

Adjunct membership is open to any Purdue University faculty or staff member. An adjunct member may not vote or hold office. The faculty advisor holds adjunct membership rights on the board. The faculty advisor is responsible for ensuring that the board adheres to university rules and restrictions, connects the board with university faculty and staff, and advises the board about difficult decisions.

Members whose undergraduate studies exceed four years are eligible for adjunct membership on the board in their final semesters. Each member may undergo an evaluation process at the end of each year to confirm that they performed their duties in accordance with the high expectations and responsibilities placed upon a board member. During this evaluation process, a member may request to withdraw from the board. According to the results of their evaluation, a member may be asked to agree to a Performance Improvement Plan to maintain their status on the Board. Members who leave the board will do so at the end of the current semester.

One member of the USB shall be designated to act as a liaison between the USB and the Computer Science Graduate Student Board in order to promote collaboration and awareness between the two organizations. The liaison shall be appointed during the spring semester to serve until the next appointee takes on the role. The liaison shall be selected via demonstrated interest and a ⅔ majority vote; if multiple members show interest, the board should follow the election rules provided for officers in the current USB Constitution. The liaison shall attend all GSB meetings and convey relevant information to the USB when necessary. If no member shows interest in the role, then a member of the executive board should take on the position for the upcoming year, as decided by the board.

The GSB will similarly designate an individual member of their board to act as a liaison to USB meetings. This GSB member will act in the same capacity described above; they will attend USB meetings as desired, and update their board members with any relevant information. The GSB representative is strictly responsible for conveying information, and shall have no voting or otherwise administrative power within the USB.

The advisors for the Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board shall be either faculty or staff and shall be chosen by the board's members. An advisor shall serve a term until they resign or is asked to resign by the officers. While an advisor is a member of the Undergraduate Student Board, they shall only act as a liaison between the organization, the Computer Science department, and the university. The advisor may not vote, hold office, or control the organization. In addition to meeting with the advisor, the board may meet with a small group of faculty and staff members to discuss current issues in the board and in the department. This small group of faculty and staff members will then be responsible for voicing the opinions and concerns of the board to the rest of the faculty.

There shall be no membership dues or fees.

## Article IV
### Officers

The leadership structure of the Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board shall consist of a board President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary. Voters will rank their choices of candidates from most preferred to least preferred. If no candidate wins a simple majority of first preference votes, the least popular candidate is removed from the race, and voters that most preferred that candidate will have their votes changed to their next preference. This process continues until one candidate reaches a simple majority. Candidates may vote. Members can elect themselves onto the voting ballot. Leadership positions shall last for a term of one year unless re-elected. Members serving as President or Vice President may only be re-elected once. Experience of at least two semesters on the board is required to be eligible for President and Vice President positions. If no eligible members are interested in electing themselves onto the voting ballot, the leadership positions will be opened to every member of the board, regardless of membership length.
