The USB Help Room has started for the Fall 2025 semester!

If you have been waiting for over 15 minutes for help with no response OR if you have general concerns or recommendations, please send either Philip Liu (liu3688@purdue.edu) or Tristan Sze (tsze@purdue.edu) an email so that we can continue to improve.

The Help Room schedule for Fall 2025 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EW0nFlXFiB5W8d35MutigJuFRrII8i3LKpNGd0-yeUI/pubhtml). Use the different sheets to view tutors by course and links to each tutor's individual Zoom meeting room. There's no need to sign up or make a reservation! Just drop by and feel free to ask any of your CS-related questions.

We also now hold in-person sessions on the first floor of DSAI (by the tables next to the front door)! Check the schedule for when tutors are there.
