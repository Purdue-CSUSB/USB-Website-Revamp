"""Decide which scraped Instagram posts are events, from image *and* caption.

USB announces events as flyer graphics: the date, time and room number are very
often burned into the image and never written in the caption. A text-only
classifier misses those, so this sends the post picture alongside its text to
Groq's vision model.

Determinism comes from three things: temperature 0 with a fixed seed, a verdict
cache keyed by post id + caption fingerprint so a post is only ever judged once,
and a keyword heuristic that takes over if Groq is unreachable.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You classify Instagram posts from Purdue University's Computer Science \
Undergraduate Student Board (USB), a student organization. For each post you are given its \
caption and its image.

An EVENT post ADVERTISES A GATHERING that USB is hosting and that students can physically \
show up to: a panel, forum, social, info session, workshop, tabling, study night, game night, \
"pizza with professors", help room hours, town hall, and so on.

Apply this test: could a student read this post, put something in their calendar, and turn up \
somewhere? If not, is_event is false. A real event post names an occasion AND tells you when \
and/or where to be - a date, a time, a room or building, or a QR/RSVP link. That detail is \
frequently only in the flyer image, not the caption, so read the image text.

Two independent reasons to answer is_event = false:

1. The image is not a designed promotional flyer. Reject candid photographs, recap photo \
dumps, group or crowd shots, screenshots, memes, and frames that look like camera footage - \
including anything with a timestamp, camera label or timecode overlaid on it. A hype caption \
over a photo is not an event announcement.

2. The post is not advertising a gathering, even though it IS a polished graphic. USB posts a \
lot of well-designed graphics that are not events, and these are the easiest mistake to make. \
Reject anything whose purpose is to celebrate, recognise, introduce or recruit a PERSON: \
"member of the month", member spotlights, honorable mentions, awards, superlatives, \
congratulations, graduate or senior send-offs, new board member announcements, officer \
introductions, birthday posts, recruitment and application callouts, and mentor or volunteer \
sign-ups. A graphic naming a student and their fun fact is a recognition post, not an event, \
however professionally it is laid out.

Also not events: recaps or thank-yous for something that already happened, holiday greetings, \
general announcements, informational infographics, merch drops, and link-in-bio reminders.

Reply with ONLY a JSON object:
{"posts": [{"id": "<post_id>", "is_event": true, "title": "<max 6 words>", "event_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null"}]}

Rules:
- Include exactly one entry for every post_id you were given, in the same order.
- "title" is a short human label, e.g. "CS Tracks Panel". Use null when is_event is false.
- "event_date" is when the event takes place, read from the caption or the flyer. Use null if \
it is not stated. If only a month and day are shown, infer the year from posted_at.
- Judge the post as a whole: a caption with no details but a flyer full of them is an event,
while an exciting caption over a photograph is not.
- When you are unsure, answer false. A missed event is better than a recognition post shown
as one."""
